# 👋 Hi, I’m @StevenKyleSmith

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **C++ developer** with a strong passion for **robotics**, **space exploration**, and **defense technologies**. Currently, I'm building my expertise in **ROS2** and creating autonomous systems to push the boundaries of what's possible in robotics.

---

## 👀 I’m Interested In
- **Robotics & Motion Planning**: Working on projects that explore pathfinding, control systems, and autonomous robots.
- **Space Exploration**: Applying robotics in space missions and beyond.
- **Defense Technologies**: Developing autonomous systems for use in aviation, defense, and UAVs.
- **Game Development**: Creating fun games and experiences.

---

## 🌱 I’m Currently Learning
- **ROS2** (Robot Operating System) and its applications for robotics simulations and real-world solutions.
- **C++**, modern **C++17/20**, and **Python** for building robust, efficient systems.
- **Simulation tools** like **Gazebo** and **RViz** to model robots in dynamic environments.
- **Control Systems & Path Planning** for autonomous navigation.

---

## 💻 Recent Project: **ROS2 Simulation Project**
I created this **ROS2 simulation** using **Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)** to demonstrate autonomous robot behavior in **turtlesim**. The project was built in **ROS2 Humble Hawksbill**.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **ROS2 Humble Hawksbill**
- **Python** for the main robot logic and simulation
- **Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)** as the development environment

### 🚀 What the Simulation Does:
- The **turtlesim** simulation demonstrates basic robot movement and state visualization.
- The robot (turtle) moves around the screen, interacts with boundaries, and changes colors based on its position.

## 🤝 I’m Looking to Collaborate On
- **Open-Source Robotics Projects**: If you're working on a robotics-related open-source project, feel free to reach out!
- **C++ Development**: I’m always open to collaborating on C++ and ROS2-based projects.
- **Game Development**: whether its a big game or small game or just brainstorming ideas and everything else inbetween, im always willing to create and contribute.

## ⚡ Fun Fact:
I’m a huge **anime** fan! My all-time favorite is **One Piece**, but I also love series like **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**, **Demon Slayer**, and **Tokyo Ghoul**.
